Steps I take to add a model:
  generate migration, rake db:migrate
  add relationships on the model level
  generate controller
  add resource routes
  write controller actions
  add jbuilder views, update dependent model views
  add backbone model (rails generate backbone:scaffold Example --javascript)
  modify backbone models + collections + dependencies
  add backbone router routes + view + template
